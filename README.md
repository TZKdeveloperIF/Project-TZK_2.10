Actually TZK_2.10 is a failure. It introduced some new units and add new mission settings, but MPMissions proved instable and cause the dedicated server "no response". The reason remain unknown.
There is a stable MPMissions version TZK_2.11A, which are, basing on TZK_2.00 MPMissions and add partly 2.10 missions' essentials to it. Those not be added mainly are 2 parts, the extend satchels/mines using pistol magazines' slot and structure marker displaying design.
TZK_3.00 MPMissions are basing on TZK_2.11A too, but the no-response server still exists. The author isn't able to find out where the problems are thus can only still upgrade 2.11A missions by adding essentials of TZK_3.00 and 2.01 Arma Resistance gradually.
Since the author recorded each steps in detail when developing 2.10, it's possible to display them here unlike just recording in TZK_1 and 2.00.

The 2.11A will be stored here as two branches of original 2.00 files and final 2.10 failures, make it more clearly to display their different. But actually, the master branch of subsequent Project TZK_3(2.12) is basing on 2.11A.
